## Java Tests in Intellij

### Create simple project with Intellij :

### New -> Project-> "java" ->"gradle" -> "add sample code"

Add Junit5 zu `build.gradle`:

```
dependencies {
    testImplementation platform('org.junit:junit-bom:5.9.1')
    testImplementation 'org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter'
}
```

Remove the "Main.java" class.

## TypeScript

### Alternative 1 : with node.js, command line and Visual Studio Code

install `node`, `npm` and `visual studio code` then:

```
mkdir my-new-project
cd my-new-project
npm init -y
npm install typescript ts-node jasmine @types/node @types/jasmine  --save-dev
```

Here's what happens when you run **npm init -y**:

1.  **npm init**: This is the standard command used to initialize a new Node.js project. It sets up the **package.json** file, which is essential for managing the project's dependencies, scripts, and other configurations.
2.  **\-y or --yes**: This flag automatically fills in default values for the **package.json** fields without prompting the user for input. It effectively answers "yes" to all the questions **npm init** would normally ask.

When you run **npm install typescript ts-node jasmine @types/node @types/jasmine --save-dev**, you're doing a few things with npm (Node Package Manager) to set up your project with TypeScript and testing tools. Here's a breakdown of what's happening:

1.  **Installing TypeScript (typescript):** This adds the TypeScript compiler to your project. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static types, making your code easier to understand and more robust. With the TypeScript compiler, you can transpile TypeScript code to plain JavaScript.
2.  **Installing TS-Node (ts-node):** This utility allows you to execute TypeScript files directly without having to manually compile them to JavaScript first. It's super handy for development and running scripts written in TypeScript on the fly.
3.  **Installing Jasmine (jasmine):** Jasmine is a popular testing framework for JavaScript. By installing it, you set up your project for writing and running tests. It helps you ensure your code works as expected.
4.  **Installing TypeScript type definitions for Node.js (@types/node):** These are type declarations for Node.js. Since TypeScript is all about types, these definitions let you work with the Node.js API in a type-safe way. This is crucial for development in a TypeScript environment where you're using Node.js.
5.  **Installing TypeScript type definitions for Jasmine (@types/jasmine):** Similar to **@types/node**, these are type declarations but for Jasmine. They allow you to write your tests in TypeScript, using Jasmine, with all the type safety and autocompletion goodies.

The **\--save-dev** flag at the end tells npm to add these packages as development dependencies in your project's **package.json** file. This means they're used for development and testing, not in your production code. It's a way to distinguish between what you need to run the application (production dependencies) and what you need to develop and test it (development dependencies).

```
npx tsc --init
```

After running the previous installations, when you execute \`npx tsc --init\`, you're invoking the TypeScript compiler with the \`--init\` flag. Here's what it does:

1.  **Generates a \`tsconfig.json\` file:** This command creates a new \`tsconfig.json\` file in your project root if one doesn't already exist. This file is a crucial part of any TypeScript project. It contains a set of configuration options for the TypeScript compiler.
2.  **Sets up compiler options:** The \`tsconfig.json\` file includes a wide range of configurable settings that determine how the TypeScript compiler should behave. For example, it specifies which version of ECMAScript (JavaScript) the TypeScript code should be compiled down to, which directories contain your TypeScript files, and which ones to exclude during the compilation process.
3.  **Facilitates project management:** By having a \`tsconfig.json\` file, you can easily manage and share compiler settings across the team, ensuring consistency in how TypeScript is compiled in different environments. It also enables IDEs and other tools to provide better support for code completion, type checking, and more, based on the project's configuration.
4.  The \`npx\` part of the command ensures that you're using the local version of the TypeScript compiler installed in your \`node_modules\` directory, rather than a globally installed version. This helps maintain consistency and avoid version conflicts between different projects.

In summary, running \`npx tsc --init\` after your initial setup prepares your project for TypeScript development by creating a \`tsconfig.json\` file with default or recommended compiler options. This step is essential for fine-tuning how your TypeScript code is compiled and managed.

```
npx jasmine init
```

This further prepares your project for testing with Jasmine by initializing a Jasmine configuration in your project. Here's what happens when you execute this command:

1.  **Creates a Jasmine configuration file:** This command generates a **spec/support/jasmine.json** file in your project. This JSON file is the Jasmine configuration file where you can specify various settings related to how your tests are run.
2.  **Sets up the default directory structure for tests:** By default, Jasmine expects your test files to be located in a **spec** directory, with your test files themselves typically named with a **.spec.js** suffix (or **.spec.ts** for TypeScript projects). The **npx jasmine init** command sets up this default directory structure by creating the **spec** folder and the **spec/support** folder, where the **jasmine.json** configuration file is placed.
3.  **Configures default behaviors:** The generated **jasmine.json** file includes some default configuration options, such as where to find test files and how to name them. For example, it might include patterns to match files ending in **spec.js** or **spec.ts** within the **spec** folder. This helps Jasmine to automatically locate and run your tests.

The purpose of running **npx jasmine init** is to quickly bootstrap your project with a standard Jasmine setup, making it easier to start writing and running tests. It saves time and ensures that your testing environment is consistent with Jasmine's conventions.

create `src` dir and add `jasmine` as testing framework:

edit `package.json`:

```
"scripts": {
    "test": "ts-node ./node_modules/.bin/jasmine"
  },
```

edit `jasmine.json`, add `../src` to the path like this:

```
"spec_files": [
    "../src/**/*[sS]pec.?(m)ts"
  ],
```

in order to  make - `*.spec.ts` files in the  `src` - directory work and change `j` to `t` to use   `TypeScript` instead of `JavaScript.`

Then  add  empty `src/greetings.ts` and `src/greetings.spec.ts` files.

### Alternative 2: Using a Angular Project in Intellij

In order to be able to write `*.spec.ts` and `*.ts`  files and to start and debug the tests ( in `*.spec.ts`) in Intellij, the easiest way I found it to create a full blow Angular project in Intellij (even if we don't do Angular at the moment) using it's `New Project`\->`Angular CLI` function.

That ensures that all the TypeScript, Jasmine and Karma config just does work out of the box. ("Karma" is the test runner for running the tests inside the `*.spec.ts` files )

Then just ignore the Angular stuff (but don't delete it!) and create a new directory in `src/app` and create your `*.spec.ts` and `*.ts` files there.

Don't forget to restart the "Karma" Server in Intellij, each time you created a new test file, otherwise the test runner will not recognize the new tests.

## 1\. Demo Greeting "Hello world!"

java->new GreetingTest(), notNull - test -> red

new Greeting()

test -> green

new requirement-> should return "Hello world!"

new test  -> red

new implmentation -> green

### Refactor String constant

test if still all greens

## Acceptance criteria (or requirements)

the developer for his work , he should get a list of acceptance criteria (or requirements), to

- change code, or
- improve code , or
- new code

## 2\. Exercise

### Exercise 1

Create a `Calculator` class from a test persepecive: create a `CalculatorTest` , add a null test that the `Calculator` - object is not null

### Exercise 2

create an `add` method that has 2 integer arguments and return the sum of those arguments as the result, test for positive and negative numbers.

### Exercise 3

create an `subtract` method that has 2 integer arguments and return the difference of those arguments as the result, test for positive and negative numbers.

### Refactor

refactor test and production code for better readablility.

## 3\. FizzBuzz kata

- Practice acceptance criteria and requirements
- kata is a set of acceptance criteria and requirements for practice
- many online resource google "tdd kata"
- we start with ["FizzBuzz" kata](https://codingdojo.org/kata/FizzBuzz/)
- should be solvable in about 4 minutes

### Show/Demo Steps:

- null, 3 div by 3, -> Fizz
- 2nd test 1 div not by 3,  -> value
- if/modulo,
- 3rd test: 6 div by 3, -> Fizz
- 4rd test div by 5 -> Buzz

### Exercice Problem and new Requirement

- 15 -> FizzBuzz ( 2 tests)

## 4\. Calculator continued

New Requirement: Calculator should accept two strings as decimals which can contain up to two decimal places and return a string of the addition. Same for subtraction:  pass in two strings which can be decimals with two decimal places and also return a String. If it's more than two decimal places it will throw an exception.
